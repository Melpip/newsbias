## 1. Introduction

*What is your project and what dilemma does it aim to address.  It should outline a news dilemma and how your project will address it.*

In March 2016, the Government tabled changes to media ownership rules set out in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth). The changes proposed to repeal the “2/3 cross media ownership” and “75% reach” rules respectively, citing a need for “traditional” platforms (Commercial Television/Radio, most Newspapers), to have greater flexibility to respond to increased pressure from “new” forms of media (i.e. online).

Although these changes do not specifically apply to online publications, they reinforce the ever-evolving landscape of media ownership in Australia. Data published by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) show that 9 individuals hold the majority of media outlets in Australia ("'Media Interests' snapshot | ACMA", 2016). The selection of senior editorial staff is often closely managed, and accusations of bias are not uncommon given the numerous private interests the owners hold.

The data provided by the ACMA is useful, but lacks granularity and is only available from a “top-down” perspective. There is no functionality for a user who wants to interrogate a specific publication or website (i.e. search from the “bottom-up”).



## 2. Concept

* Identify the target users/audience and what makes your idea different from existing solutions.*

News Bias is a web app that will highlight ownership, key stakeholders, reach, and a crowdsourced trust rating for news web sites that users search for. 

There are two main parts to the web app: Search and Fact Check.

### Search
Users can enter a web address (whole site or specific article) to search for the details of that news outlet.  They will be presented with ownership, key stakeholders and reach data for that news site.  A crowdsourced trust rating is also shown and users have the option to contribute to the trust rating.  If the site has no data, users can submit for it to be added to our database.

### Fact Check
User can submit a quote and a link to an article to be fact checked by a team of vetted volunteers.  Results are displayed publically and requester is emailed. 

**Possible guidelines/parameters for fact check**
*Is the content factually correct (All aspects / most aspects / few aspects / no aspects)
*Have aspects been presented in an even and balanced manner (Both sides evenly considered / Some degree of bias / Large degree of bias)
*Is the headline reflective of the article’s content (i.e. is it clickbait?)
*How sensational is the tone (Heavily sensationalised and exaggerated / Somewhat sensationalised and exaggerated / Generally not sensationalised)

### Strech goals
*A further breakdown of the trust rating by non-identifiable demographics, e.g. 34% conservatives vs 65% liberals find a source trustworthy.
*Chrome extension for users to check sites as they encounter them without having to navigate to a seperate site

### Audience
Our solution is aimed at people who are interested in who owns their news and how that might affect the bias of the news they read regularly


## 3. Team

### 3.1 Individual Roles & Responsibilities

**All team members will contribute to all aspects of the assessment.**  Team roles are to facilitate the different aspects of our project and follow up with other team members on their areas of responsibility.

Logistics including equipment, meetings, transport will be shared by all team members.  Each team member is responsible for thier own transport to workshops and meetings, and development environment. 
All of the logistic responsibilities will be equally shared to all of the team member.

### 3.2 Decision Making

Decisions will be made collaboratively.  If no consensus is reached, decisions will be voted on.  In the event of an even split, the person responsible for each section will have final say.

### 3.3 Conflict resolution and poor performance

In the event of group conflict, we will:
*Admit there is a conflict that needs to be resolved
*Approach team members involved to understand problem from all perspectives
*Mediate an agreeable resolution after understanding the problem and move on if conflict is solved.
*If problem is still present, we will inform tutors to seek advice.

**Underperformance**
The whole group will discuss and evaluate the underperforming person’s role, and responsibilities to possibly be reallocated. In the circumstance that members still do not participate equally after multiple discussions the course coordinator will be informed.  All team members acknowledge that this may result in individual grade being reduced.


## 4. Communications

A private group community has been set-up on Facebook for group communication.  A shared Google Drive folder has been set-up to work collaboratively on documents. 

Our GitHub repository for storing and collaborating on code https://github.com/deco3500/newsbias

Meeting times
We will be meeting during the workshop session (Wednesday 4pm).  In addition to the course requirement to attend, it is a group expectation that all group members will attend these every week.  Additional meetings will be scheduled as needed.

Where and when will your team meet and how will you all communicate?
Where will files be stored and shared? 
What are the file naming conventions? 
Identify the social platform/s your team has adopted and explain the choice. How will it facilitate communication and / or file sharing? 


## 5. Plan

* Outline the work to be done and what will be produced as a result. *

### 5.1 Project Phases

####Research
* news ownership information available
* technical development environment

#### Design
* wireframes
* UI design
* UI testing

#### Construction
* front end development
* back end development

####Prototypes
Both a low and high fidelity prototype will be produced.  

**High Fidelity: Search**
The 'Search' feature will be a high fidelity prototype that users can search news sites/articles and see results.  A database of news sites will be developed,initially with a small amount of data with a view to make this as robust as possible for final prototype. The crowd-sourced trust rating will also be functional.  We plan to use AngularJS to complete this aspect.  There will also be a form to submit sites not yet listed

**Low Fidelity: Fact Check**
Users will be able to see how to submit article, how to become a volunteer and view sample results page. No actual volunteer fact checkers will be developed for this prototype.  

**Approach**
We plan to use a mobile-first approach in designing and developing this web app using responsive technologies like the [W3 CSS grid layout](http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/).
