## 1. Introduction

*What is your project and what dilemma does it aim to address.  It should outline a news dilemma and how your project will address it. Identify the target users/audience and what makes your idea different from existing solutions. Outline the work to be done and what will be produced as a result.*

In March 2016, the Government tabled changes to media ownership rules set out in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth). The changes proposed to repeal the “2/3 cross media ownership” and “75% reach” rules respectively, citing a need for “traditional” platforms (Commercial Television/Radio, most Newspapers), to have greater flexibility to respond to increased pressure from “new” forms of media (i.e. online).

Although these changes do not specifically apply to online publications, they reinforce the ever-evolving landscape of media ownership in Australia. Data published by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) show that 9 individuals hold the majority of media outlets in Australia ("'Media Interests' snapshot | ACMA", 2016). The selection of senior editorial staff is often closely managed, and accusations of bias are not uncommon given the numerous private interests the owners hold.

The data provided by the ACMA is useful, but lacks granularity and is only available from a “top-down” perspective. There is no functionality for a user who wants to interrogate a specific publication or website (i.e. search from the “bottom-up”).


## 2. Concept

* News Bias is a web app that…

outline the idea and the rationale behind it. Define the project aims and audience and identify how your idea is different from / improves upon other current offerings. *

Our web-app will highlight ownership, key stakeholders, reach, and a crowdsourced trust rating for news web sites that users search for. 

Use Case:
SEARCH
-Users enter a web address (whole site or specific article)
-ownership, key stakeholders and reach for that news site is provided
-crowdsourced trust rating is shown
-users have the option to contribute to the trust rating
-may add other data to breakdown trust rating (i.e 34% conservatives vs 65% liberals find a source trustworthy.)
-if site has no data, submit it to be added

2)	FACT CHECK
-submit a quote and a link to an article to be fact checked by volunteers
-results are displayed publically and requester is email


Guidelines/Parameters volunteers might check against (score for each category?):
Is the content factually correct 
(All aspects / most aspects / few aspects / no aspects)
Have aspects been presented in an even and balanced manner 
(Both sides evenly considered / Some degree of bias / Large degree of bias)
Is the headline reflective of the article’s content 
(i.e. is it clickbait?)
How sensational is the tone 
(Heavily sensationalised and exaggerated / Somewhat sensationalised and exaggerated / Generally not sensationalised)


## 3. Team

### 3.1 Individual Roles & Responsibilities

**All team members will contribute to all aspects of the assessment.**  Team roles are to facilitate the different aspects of our project and follow up with other team members on their areas of responsibility.

Logistics including equipment, meetings, transport will be shared by all team members.  Each team member is responsible for thier own transport to workshops and meetings, and development environment. 
All of the logistic responsibilities will be equally shared to all of the team member.

### 3.2 Decision Making

Decisions will be made collaboratively.  In the event where we do not reach consensus, decisions will be put to a vote.

### 3.3 Conflict Resolution and Poor performance

If conflict arises, we will proceed the following:
Admit that conflict is present and it needs to be resolved, by approaching the team members involved we will understand the problem from all perspectives.
Reach for an agreement after understanding the problem and move on if conflict is solved.
If problem is still present, we will inform tutors and seek advice.

Underperformance
Discussion with the whole group to re-evaluate the underperforming person’s role, responsibilities could be reallocated. In the circumstance that members still do not participate equally after multiple discussions the course coordinator will be informed and grade may be reduced.


## 4. Communications

A private group community has been set-up on Facebook for group communication.  A shared Google Drive folder has been set-up to work collaboratively on documents. 

Our GitHub repository for storing and collaborating on code https://github.com/deco3500/newsbias

Meeting times
We will be meeting during the workshop session (Wednesday 4pm).  In addition to the course requirement to attend, it is a group expectation that all group members will attend these every week.  Additional meetings will be scheduled as needed.

Where and when will your team meet and how will you all communicate?
Where will files be stored and shared? 
What are the file naming conventions? 
Identify the social platform/s your team has adopted and explain the choice. How will it facilitate communication and / or file sharing? 


## 5. Plan

### 5.1 Project Phases

####Research
* news ownership information available
* technical development environment

#### Design
* wireframes
* UI design
* UI testing

#### Construction
* front end development
* back end development


Two parts: low and high fidelity prototype

Overall:
http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/ for responsive grid layout

High Fidelity: Search
Database of news sites that are checked against, initially small amount of data, see how much we can get
Use AngularJS to do crowdsourced rating
Form to submit sites not yet listed

Low Fidelity: Fact Check
-Show how to submit article, how to become a volunteer and sample results page
-No actual volunteer fact checkers,
